        <h3>
            Pollution Awareness
        </h3>
        <img src="Images/pollution.png">
        <p>
            Pollution does not simply harm the environment, it can also harm us directly. For example air pollution can burn our eyes and create difficulty in breathing. 
            This increases the chances of lung cancer. In addition, greenhouse gases, also considered pollutants, will trap sunlight warming the earth up and this causes global warming.

        <h3>
            Genetic Engineering Awareness
        </h3>
        <img src="Images/DNA.png">
        <p>
            Genetically engineered plants may be that we could get more food during a harvest season. However the opposite could happen as well. Because there is less biodiversity if the plants flourish, then there is a lot of food for people to eat but if the plants die, then they will all die. Genetic engineering could also have unintended side effects like causing the taste to become worse.

        <h3>
            Nuclear Waste Awareness
        </h3>
        <img src="Images/Radiation.png">
        <p>
            Radiation poisoning can cause nausea, vomiting, hair loss, diarrea, hemorrhage, destruction of intestinal lining, central nervous system damage, and death. The radiation can also cause damage to DNA and increase the risk of cancer.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Global Warming Awareness
        </h3>
        <img src="Images/Global_Warming.png">
        <p>
            Global warming also has many indirect effects on humans. As it leads to an increase in temperature, this may in turn cause health hazards, sea level increase, and agricultural difficulties. 
            In addition, global warming can also lead to poor air quality which is also a health hazard. For instance, the increase in temperature can cause heat strokes, hypothermia, damage lung tissue, and increase the risk for asthma, heart, and lung patients. 
            This means that seniors and those with medical conditions are especially susceptible to the health-depleting and devastating effects of global warming.

        <h3>
            Deforestation Awareness
        </h3>
        <img src="Images/Forest.png">
        <p>
            Deforestation increases the spread of disease: animals who tend to survive the effects of deforestation (like bats and rats) are more likely to carry deadly diseases which are then transferred to humans. Deforestation also causes animals to leave their habitats, leading to more interactions between animals and humans and a greater risk of disease transfer.  Deforestation also contributes to the destruction of homelands and resources.
