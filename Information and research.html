<h1>Genetic Engineering</h1>
    <img src="Images/1998226.png">
<h4><u>Context</u></h4>
<p>
Genetic Engineering is the process  where DNA is spliced in order to create a new recombinant DNA. When the cells reproduce, the new recombinant DNA is now in those cells.
</p>
    <h4><u>PROBLEM</u></h4>
        <p>
            One problem with genetic engineering is that it lowers the biodiversity of the ecosystem. This
means that if there is a change in the environment, the gene spliced plants may not be able to
survive. Another problem is that the genetically modified plants may be able to cause pathogen
to adapt faster. Because genetically modified plants can take DNA to be immune to specific
diseases, the viruses may be able to adapt as they need a host to reproduce.
        </p>
            <h4><u>EFFECT ON THE ENVIORNMENT</u></h4>
                <p>
                    This may cause the amount of plants to decrease if a big disease hits the plants as they are so
similar and will all be affected by the same viruses. This could lead to massive food problems in
the ecosystem, lowering the carrying capacity and killing many animals
                </p>
                    <h4><u>Effects on the Human Population</u></h4>
                        <p>
                            One effect of genetically engineered plants may be that we could get more food during a harvest season. However the opposite
                            could happen as well. Because there is less biodiversity if the plants flourish, then there is a lot of food for people to eat but if the plants die, then they will all die. Genetic engineering could also have unintended side effects like causing the taste to become worse.
                        </p>
                            <h4><u>Genetic Engineering and Human Agriculture</u></h4>
                                <p>
                                    Genetic engineering is still an experimental technology at its best, due to unforeseeable contamination and gene results. Although it applies to all organisms, humans are the most susceptible to bioengineered plants, especially those that are used for agriculture. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMO) can reproduce either on their own and spread uncontrollably, or reproduce with other organisms, usually similar species or the natural variation of that organisms, and create hybrids. This is a concern because GMOs can make their way into the plants humans consume. Although studies from credible sources such as Harvard University have shown that certified GMOs have little to no negative effects on human health, many people still refuse to eat modified organisms. 

GMOs must be approved by the Federal Department of Agriculture, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the United States Department of Agriculture (FDA) to be released to the public, but many certified products do not need to be labeled in the United States until 2022, according to the FDA. Therefore, people may be unaware that they are consuming modified organisms. However, the main threat to humans are uncertified GMOs, as private companies can conduct bioengineering in the United States, according to the “Down to Earth” organization. Syngenta, Monsanto, and Prodigene are examples of private companies that have each caused a GMO contamination accident at least once, leading to the destruction of products and farmland to quarantine the GMOs and/or the rejection of exported products by trade partners such as Japan. Uncertified GMOs can leak into the food supply or into ecosystems, transferring their genes through reproduction. For instance, herbicide resistant Bentgrass has leaked in Oregon and reproduced with native grass species in some areas, reducing biodiversity in those regions. Altered genes in crops can lead to allergies, increased toxicity, and other unforeseeable health risks. Although everyone is susceptible to these health concerns, developing countries and people with low income are less prepared to deal with GMO contamination. For example, in the June of 2021, a GMO rice shipment was traced back to India, where only natural rice is supposed to grow, according to the Canadian Biotechnology Action Network. This poses many questions about the lack of awareness and early detection, as no one knew of the existence of genetically modified rice in India until it was shipped to European countries.

                                        <h1>Nuclear Waste</h1>
    <img src="Images/34-343315_transparent-radioactive-sign-png-toxic-waste-clip-art.png">
                                            <h4><u>What is Nuclear Waste</u></h4>
                                                <p>
                                                    Nuclear power generation utilizes the energy released from splitting the atoms of specific elements.
                                                    It is one of the leading carbon energy sources, providing rougly 10% of the world's electricity. However,
                                                    nuclear power  has downsides that are different from that of traditional fossil fuels. The cost of using nuclear
                                                    power plants is nuclear waste, which are dangerous radiactive byproducts of nuclear fission.  
                                                </p>
                                                    <h4><u>How Nuclear Waste Affects Humans</u></h4>
                                                        <p>
                                                            Some nuclear power plants are located near water, in order to use the water to cool the reactors. If the waste is improperly stored or the reactor has some sort of malfunction, there is a sizable risk of the contamination of the water. Contaminating a water source can be devastating to the people in that area as well as the environment, as it can spread easily. Radiation poisoning can cause nausea, vomiting, hair loss, diarrea, hemorrhage, destruction of intestinal lining, central nervous system damage, and death. The radiation can also cause damage to DNA and increase the risk of cancer. 
One of the most famous reactor accidents was the Chernobyl accident in 1986. The plant had a flawed design and the workers were inadequately trained. The explosion and resulting fires released around 5% of the radioactive core into the environment. That explosion also killed 2 factory workers, and later on 43 deaths in the surrounding area from radiation poisoning and the related cancer.

                                                        </p>
                                                            <h4><u>Resolutions</u></h4>
                                                                <p>
                                                                    The solution for these dangers is simple. Proper disposal and transportation methods. Radioactive waste becomes less and less dangerous the longer it is left alone. The most effective method of storing nuclear waste is deep geological storage. It’s the safest option, as the rock covering it blocks the radiation, and it is out of the way of civilians.

                        <h1>Deforestation</h1>
    <img src="Images/373-3730792_deforestation-png-fallen-tree-clip-art.png">
                                                                <h4><u>What  is  Deforestation</u></h4>
                                                                    <p>
                                                                        Deforestation is purposeful clearing of forested land, mainly to harvest wood or to make space for agriculture, urbanization, and animal grazing. Wood is used in manufacturing, burned for fuel, and used in construction. Deforestation is disproportionately higher in Africa and South America. 50% of deforestation is used for farming (especially soy and palm oil), livestock pastures (especially cows), mining, and drilling, which all have negative impacts of their own. The loss of forest land contributes to global warming, leading to more forest fires and droughts, which in turn leads to less forests and so on.
                                                                    </p>
        <h4><u>Effects on the enviornment and ecosystem</u></h4>
                                <p>
                                    Deforestation impacts nearby ecosystems, and all the organisms living inside them. About 80% of the Earth’s land animals live in forests, and when trees are cut down, animals are stripped of their habitat and the resources they need to survive. Forests like the Amazon also influence the weather patterns around the world. Forests retain water and heat and maintain a stable environment for plants and animals to thrive in. Forests keep the soil in place and prevent erosion. Without forests, dry and fragile soil is more likely to cause natural disasters in the area. For example, lack of forest area could result in more extreme landslides and avalanches, because hills are more exposed, making the area more prone to severe consequences. Additionally, the loss of forests both releases CO2 and decreases the amount of CO2 that can be absorbed– causing nearly 20% of greenhouse gas emissions. Without forests, many plants and animals would not be able to continue existing.
                                </p>
                                <h4><u>Effects on the human population</u></h4>
                                <p>
                                    Deforestation increases the spread of disease: animals who tend to survive the effects of deforestation (like bats and rats) are more likely to carry deadly diseases which are then transferred to humans. Deforestation also causes animals to leave their habitats, leading to more interactions between animals and humans and a greater risk of disease transfer.  Deforestation also contributes to the destruction of homelands and resources. Indigeonous people who live in forests depend on its resources to survive, and taking forests away threatens their homes and food sources. People living in or around areas of deforestation are also more prone to natural disasters due to the lack of protection that trees offer. Also in underdeveloped areas, people lose access to forest goods and services, which limits the developments of impoverished countries. 250 million people around the world living in forests and savannas depend on forests for income and sustenance. Over half of the world population depends on forested watersheds for clean drinking water. 
People living in Brazil, Peru and Bolivia especially are heavily impacted by deforestation, because they have access to the Amazon. Millions of acres of forest land has been cut down, which devastates all 3 of these countries. In 2019, the GDP per capita of Bolivia was $2559.51, making it one of the poorest countries in the western hemisphere. Though forests could have a beneficial effect on the economy, it is only temporary due to the limited number of trees.

             <h4><u>What is global warming?</u></h4>    
                                <p>
                                    n essence, global warming is an increase in the Earth’s average temperature. It is caused by multiple human activities, the most prominent being the emission of greenhouse gases. These gases trap heat in the atmosphere, slowly heating up the Earth’s surface. According to NASA, the Earth’s average global temperature is steadily increasing by 0.2 degrees Celsius per decade, which may have more detrimental effects than expected. For instance, global warming may increase the amount of natural disasters such as forest fires, hurricanes, earthquakes, and heatwaves experienced by the average human during a lifetime.
                                </p>
                                    <h4><u>How will this issue impact the Earth's ecosystem</u></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Global warming is without a doubt a threat to the Earth’s ecosystems. Not only may it wreak havoc on natural habitats, but it may also alter the timing of seasonal blooms and life cycle events. The irregularity of weather patterns (also known as climate change) is affecting timing of crucial events such as migration and hibernation, as well as requiring many species to adapt to new environments faster than what is realistic. Lastly, global warming is also contributing to the melting of sea ice, and therefore destroying many arctic species’ ecosystems. Let’s take polar bears for example. It’s well known that polar bears are being stranded due to the constant melting of arctic ice, but there are also many deeper climate change-related issues that they are facing. For one, the arctic food chain has been greatly deformed by human-induced global warming as of recently. At the bottom of this food chain lies ice algae, which, as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) states, “thrive in nutrient-rich pockets in the ice”. A decrease in these natural ice pockets may in turn decrease the ice algae population and ultimately the entirety of the rest of the food chain -- polar bears included. In conclusion, global warming has many effects on the biosphere and it’s many habitats, in both obvious and underlying ways.
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><u>How does the issue affect the human population?</u></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Global warming also has many indirect effects on humans. As it leads to an increase in temperature, this may in turn cause health hazards, sea level increase, and agricultural difficulties. In addition, global warming can also lead to poor air quality which is also a health hazard. For instance, the increase in temperature can cause heat strokes, hypothermia, damage lung tissue, and increase the risk for asthma, heart, and lung patients. This means that seniors and those with medical conditions are especially susceptible to the health-depleting and devastating effects of global warming. Furthermore, disease is also a factor heavily associated with global warming, often harming poor, developing communities. As the United Nations states, “ In places like Africa, an increase in temperature signifies an increase in mosquito populations, thus escalating the risk of malaria, dengue and other insect-borne infections.” Another way Global warming has affected humans is through the melting of sea ice and increasing sea level. Because the sea level has risen, many coastal areas where humans live are getting submerged into water -- in other words, people are losing homes as a result of global warming. Not only does global warming affect sea level, it also affects our environment and climate. It may cause droughts thereby ruining agriculture in places with little rainfall. It may cause fires destroying ecosystems and cause air pollution which can lead to other environmental issues. Lastly, according to an article by David Herring and Rebecca Lindsey,  “The frequency and intensity of heavy downpours has increased and is likely to increase further, raising the risk of flash flooding…. ” All in all, global warming is a worldwide phenomenon that must be dealt with quickly -- otherwise dire problems will arise for ecosystems and humanity itself. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><u>Remedies</u></h4>
                                    <p>
                                        Global warming is not something that we can fix in a day or two, it requires long term solutions. Carbon dioxide is one of the main gases that contributes to global warming as we need to decrease our emission of it. For example, we need to change to renewable energy that doesn’t pollute the environment. In addition, we all need to conserve energy, using less energy means that less energy is being released into the atmosphere. For example, Melissa Denchal says,          “Since they were first implemented nationally in 1987, efficiency standards for dozens of appliances and products have kept 2.3 billion tons of carbon dioxide out of the air.” By reducing less carbon dioxide we can reduce the amount of greenhouse gases thereby decreasing the effects of global warming. 
Smaller, more personal changes to lifestyle can also aid in getting this issue under control. For instance, because the processing of food and water waste is associated with large greenhouse gas emissions, minimizing this waste can aid in decreasing the need for said emissions. Composting, preserving lights and electronic use, and using tap water attentively are all examples of minimizing waste. Furthermore, if possible, investing in energy-efficient appliances can also have a positive effect on this crisis. Finally, not only is making these choices important individually, but it is also crucial to spread awareness about global warming -- we won’t be able to resolve this issue in the long run without the commitment of large numbers of people. 
Lastly, we can also solve global warming by increasing the amount of plants such as trees. Through the process of photosynthesis, plants can convert carbon dioxide and water into oxygen and glucose. This can also reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere while increasing the amount of oxygen for us.

                    <h1>Pollution</h1>
    <img src="Images/007fc35dc23efe8efed1818085dd00b2.png">
                    <h4><u>What is pollution</u></h4>
                    <p>
                        Pollution is the release of harmful substances, or pollutants, into the environment. Often many of these pollutants are man made, for example: 
Waste produced by cars, factories, etc
burning fossil fuels
generating garbage and dumping it into the environment.
This can cause huge impacts on wildlife and humanity, negatively.

                    </p>
                    <h4><u>How does it affect environment and ecosystems</u></h4>
                    <p>
                        These harmful pollutants can affect wildlife and the environment. Water pollution is the dumping of waste (harmful) into the oceans and rivers. Oil and natural gas may leak into the ocean and may harm the ecosystem and the organisms that live in it. Loss of organisms in an ecosystem will lead to instability in the environment and to a loss of ecosystem.

In addition, when nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide (produced by factories) are mixed with moisture they become acid. Then they fall to earth as acid rain. Acid rain is a huge problem to the environment because it can kill forests, contaminate water in rivers, etc and kill fishes and other organisms that live in the water.

                    </u></h4>
                    <p>
                        Pollution does not simply harm the environment, it can also harm us directly. For example air pollution can burn our eyes and create difficulty in breathing. This increases the chances of lung cancer. Most air pollution comes from burning fossil fuels; cars and trucks produce carbon monoxide that is very harmful in higher concentrations. Factories produce nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, and hydrocarbons. These pollutants react to sunlight and create smog. This can also create difficulty in breathing and seeing the sun. In addition, greenhouse gases, also considered pollutants, will trap sunlight warming the earth up. This causes global warming. Global warming will increase storms (floodings) and droughts. CFC, a different type of pollutant mass produced by humans, will damage the ozone layer and increase chances of getting skin cancer and other health problems.
                    </p>
                    <h4><u>
                        Populations affected by pollution
                    </u></h4>
                    <p>
                        Despite pollution being a global problem, one example of a specific population affected by pollution is of colored people. Asthma is a consequence of air pollution and often occurs in colored people. Also children who grow up breathing air pollution can put them at greater risk of lung diseases when they grow up. People with low income usually live near factories and highways putting them at greater risk.
                    </p>
                    <h4><u>
                        Possible Resolutions
                    </u></h4>
                    <p>
                        Possible resolutions to pollution is to switch to green energy and stop burning fossil fuels. Conserve energy, use a cleaner way of commuting (or use public transportation when possible), reduce the amount of trips you take with your cars, recycle and reuse, and make sure to dump your trash in the right places.
